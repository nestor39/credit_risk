# credit risk resampling


This code was created with the purpose of using various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. I used a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, I used the original dataset. Second, I resampled the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

## Technologies
```
numpy 
pandas 
pathlib 
sklearn.metrics 
sklearn.metrics 
imblearn.metrics
```

## Installation

In order to open and run this program you have to follow these steps:

* Go to my repository in GitHub and open the repository called ```credit_risk_12```

* Copy the repository's link.

* Clone the repository by typing ```git clone``` and paste the link ``` git@github.com:nestor39/credit_risk_12.git ```.





After doing the steps above you are going to have the files in your computer, now we are going to need to open it:

 * Open Git Bash in your computer.
  
  * Activate  the Conda development environment, by typing ```conda activate dev```.
    * Install imbalance-learn ```conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn```.
    * Install PyDotPlus ```conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus```.
  
 * Type  ```jupyter lab"``` in your Git Bash(it will open a tab in your explorer).
  
 * Open the file ```credit_risk_resampling.ipynb``` and you are going to be able to see the code.
  
  * Run the code.
